# General-Relativity--Study-Notes
This public repository documents my learning journey through *A First Course in General Relativity* by Bernard Schutz. It serves as a platform to showcase most of my carefully completed derivations drawn from the textbook and my personal reflections in this subject.    

Just as I mentioned in the README.md file of my Quantum_Field_Theory repository, I take a deep interest in the community's efforts devoted to unifying gravitation and gauge forces, while a solid grasp of Einstein's theory (i.e. general relativity) describing the intricate mathematical relationship between matter-energy distribution and curvature (together with metric tensor) is also essential for understanding why the newly developing theory is expected to be independent of any fixed spacetime background (actually with the metric tensor various under certain equations of motion). Driven by an intense intellectual curiosity about the essence of gravitation and how the gravitational field evolves, I have devoted significant time to carefully studying general relativity and its relative maths (mostly basing on the textbook *A First Course in General Relativity* by Bernard Schutz) since immigrating to the United States. Prior to this, I had already built a strong foundation in undergraduate-level mathematics and physics while studying in high school in China. My background includes linear algrebra, differential equations, grounp theory, analytical mechanics and quantum mechanics.  These disciplines equipped me with both theoretical foundation and the analytical skills required for understanding general relativity.

The content in this repository spans from special relativity and the mathematical foundations (i.e. tensor analysis, etc.) to the core ideas of general relativity. My approach emphasizes clarity and mathematical rigor, reflecting both the depth and continuity of my study.    

 I hope this repository may also serve as a helpful reference for students with similar interests, and I welcome any feedback or discussion.      

Last but not least, I strongly recommend you to click into the Quantum_Field_Theory repository and another repository displaying my paper *Chern-Simons Theory in Topological Quantum Field Theory* (the repository's name is Chern-Simons_Theory_in_Topological_Quantum_Field_Theory) pinned on my GitHub profile (homepage). These two repositories are the ones I'm most proud of and also the most content-rich. They showcase many of my key thoughts and insights developed during my academic growth. This paper in particular was carefully structured, with each section thoughtfully curated based on a thorough review of past work for Chern-Simons Theory. In order to finish this paper, I have dedicated several months studying dozens of references and covering countless abstract calculation (which is really not an easy task for me). I believe you may find them both inspiring and thought-provoking.
