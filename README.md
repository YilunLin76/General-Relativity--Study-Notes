# General-Relativity--Study-Notes
This public repository documents my learning journey through *A First Course in General Relativity* by Bernard Schutz. It serves as a platform to showcase most of my carefully completed derivations drawn from the textbook and my personal reflections in the field.    

The content in this repository spans from special relativity and the mathematical foundations (i.e. tensor analysis, etc.) to the core ideas of general relativity. My approach emphasizes clarity and mathematical rigor, reflecting both the depth and continuity of my study.    

My intense intellectual curiosity about the mathematical structure of curved spacetime and gravitation has driven me to study general relativity systematically. I have devoted significant time to developing a solid and coherent understanding of this subject since immigrating to the United States. Prior to this, I had already built a strong foundation in undergraduate-level mathematics and physics while studying in high school in China. My background includes linear algrebra, differential equations, grounp theory, analytical mechanics and quantum mechanics.  These disciplines equipped me with both theoretical foundation and the analytical skills required for understanding general relativity.   

I hope this repository may also serve as a helpful reference for students with similar interests, and I welcome any feedback or discussion.
