# General-Relativity--Study-Notes
This public repository documents my learning journey through *A First Course in General Relativity* by Bernard Schutz. It serves as a platform to showcase most of my carefully completed derivations drawn from the textbook and my personal reflections in the field.  
The content in this repository spans from special relativity and the mathematical foundations (i.e. tensor analysis, etc.) to the core ideas of general relativity.
